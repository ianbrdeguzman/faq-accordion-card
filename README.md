## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-   Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
